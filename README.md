[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter)

Prometheus exporter for various metrics about Elasticsearch, written in Go.

### Installation

For pre-built binaries please take a look at the releases.
<https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter/releases>

#### Docker

```bash
docker pull quay.io/prometheuscommunity/elasticsearch-exporter:latest
docker run --rm -p 9114:9114 quay.io/prometheuscommunity/elasticsearch-exporter:latest
```

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
elasticsearch_exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheuscommunity/elasticsearch-exporter:latest
    command:
     - '--es.uri=http://elasticsearch:9200'
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:9114:9114"
```

#### Kubernetes

You can find a helm chart in the prometheus-community charts repository at <https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus-elasticsearch-exporter>

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/prometheus-elasticsearch-exporter
```

### Configuration

**NOTE:** The exporter fetches information from an Elasticsearch cluster on every scrape, therefore having a too short scrape interval can impose load on ES master nodes, particularly if you run with `--es.all` and `--es.indices`. We suggest you measure how long fetching `/_nodes/stats` and `/_all/_stats` takes for your ES cluster to determine whether your scraping interval is too short. As a last resort, you can scrape this exporter using a dedicated job with its own scraping interval.

Below is the command line options summary:

```bash

Commandline parameters start with a single `-` for versions less than `1.1.0rc1`.
For versions greater than `1.1.0rc1`, commandline parameters are specified with `--`.

The API key used to connect can be set with the `ES_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### Logging

Logging by the exporter is handled by the `log/slog` package. The output format can be customized with the `--log.format` flag which defaults to logfmt. The log level can be set with the `--log.level` flag which defaults to info. The output can be set to either stdout (default) or stderr with the `--log.output` flag.

#### Elasticsearch 7.x security privileges

Username and password can be passed either directly in the URI or through the `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD` environment variables.
Specifying those two environment variables will override authentication passed in the URI (if any).

ES 7.x supports RBACs. The following security privileges are required for the elasticsearch_exporter.

Setting | Privilege Required | Description
:---- | :---- | :----
collector.clustersettings| `cluster` `monitor` |
exporter defaults | `cluster` `monitor` | All cluster read-only operations, like cluster health and state, hot threads, node info, node and cluster stats, and pending cluster tasks. |
es.indices | `indices` `monitor` (per index or `*`) | All actions that are required for monitoring (recovery, segments info, index stats and status)
es.indices_settings | `indices` `monitor` (per index or `*`) |
es.indices_mappings | `indices` `view_index_metadata` (per index or `*`) |
es.shards | not sure if `indices` or `cluster` `monitor` or both |
collector.snapshots | `cluster:admin/snapshot/status` and `cluster:admin/repository/get` | [ES Forum Post](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/permissions-for-backup-user-with-x-pack/88057)
es.slm | `manage_slm`
es.data_stream | `monitor` or `manage` (per index or `*`) |

### Alerts & Recording Rules

We provide examples for [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io) [alerts and recording rules](examples/prometheus/elasticsearch.rules) as well as an [Grafana](http://www.grafana.org) [Dashboard](examples/grafana/dashboard.json) and a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) [Deployment](examples/kubernetes/deployment.yml).

The example dashboard needs the [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) installed. In order to select the nodes that belong to the Elasticsearch cluster, we rely on a label `cluster`.
Depending on your setup, it can derived from the platform metadata:

For example on [GCE](https://cloud.google.com)

```
- source_labels: [__meta_gce_metadata_Cluster]
  separator: ;
  regex: (.*)
  target_label: cluster
  replacement: ${1}
  action: replace
```

Please refer to the [Prometheus SD documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/) to see which metadata labels can be used to create the `cluster` label.
